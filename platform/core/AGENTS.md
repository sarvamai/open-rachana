# `platform/core/` — `mulyankan-platform`

The workflow core: provider registry, hash-chained audit log, session
monitoring, and the FastAPI `core_api` (`GET /healthz`, plus the
session-monitoring surface of ASR02-OBS-01).

## What is here

- `registry.py` — `ProviderRegistry` resolves `"module:attr"` bindings from
  `platform.yaml` via `importlib`. The core never imports a provider any
  other way; malformed or unloadable bindings raise at startup, an unbound
  capability at call time. `get_typed(spi, protocol)` additionally checks
  the instance against the SPI's `runtime_checkable` Protocol and refuses a
  provider that does not satisfy it — call sites get a typed instance, not
  `Any`.
- `audit/chain.py` — the append-only audit chain (below).
- `core_api/main.py` — assembly only: config loading
  (`$MULYANKAN_PLATFORM_CONFIG`; no file is committed, and with none the app
  starts with zero bindings), CORS, the lifespan sweeper, `/healthz`. The
  endpoints live in `core_api/routers/` — `sessions.py`
  (`/v1/sessions…`, `/v1/integrity/sessions`) and `sources.py`
  (`/sources` upload + extraction).
- `sessions/monitor.py` — session register/heartbeat/close (ASR02-OBS-01, a
  platform concern per ADR-0004) and the first monitoring signal:
  client-reported copy/cut/paste or a server-detected heartbeat gap. A signal
  deducts a fixed amount from the integrity score (starts at 100, never
  recovers in-session) and appends a content-free security event to the audit
  chain; automatic suspension stays off. The score rides the event's payload
  hash — event fields stay opaque. The in-memory store is M1 scaffolding; the
  database-backed store keeps each state change and its audit event in one
  transaction (ARC-02).

  Reads and writes are deliberately separate, and the split is the part the
  database store inherits:

  - `integrity_view` is **pure**. `silent` is derived from the clock, so
    polling the operator view — a refresh, a retry, a prober — cannot alter a
    score or the chain. It is also filtered and bounded (`status`, `limit`):
    "return everything" is not a shape that ports to a table.
  - `sweep` is the **only** writer of gap signals, idempotent per silence
    episode, and stamps the event at `last_heartbeat_at + GAP_THRESHOLD` — when
    the gap happened, not when the sweep noticed. One lifespan task drives it
    here; a single-writer guard drives it once there is more than one replica.
  - Every public method holds the monitor's lock, and `AuditLog.append` holds
    its own: the handlers are sync `def`, so Starlette runs them concurrently
    on the threadpool and both maps are genuinely shared.
  - The record keeps counters, not per-signal history — the chain is the log.
    Closed sessions are evicted after `CLOSED_RETENTION` (archival, in M1).

  **Unauthenticated.** Nothing validates a caller, and the `session_id` the
  operator view publishes is the bearer for every write. Read "Known
  limitations" in `SECURITY.md` before exposing this anywhere.
- `sources/` — `models.py` (Source, stages, counts-only summary) and
  `store.py` (in-memory index over workspace files). Every public method
  holds the store's lock, and artefact writes go through the `*_if_live`
  guards — check-then-write is atomic under the lock, so a delete racing
  the extraction job cannot resurrect a deleted source's directory. No
  audit events yet: without a database there is no transaction to commit
  one with (invariant 2).
- `ingestion/pipeline.py` — the three-stage extraction job (read → pages →
  cover), blocking work in worker threads, record mutation on the event
  loop only. Decides per page whether the text layer is usable — the
  platform's judgement, not the provider's — and logs counts, never text.
- `tests/` — registry, audit-chain, healthz, session-monitor, and
  sources/ingestion tests; requirement-facing names carry their ID
  (`test_asrevd02_...`, `test_asr02obs01_...`).

## `audit/chain.py` is wire format, not style

- `canonical_bytes`: sorted keys, `(",", ":")`, `ensure_ascii=False`, UTF-8.
  Changing any of it changes every hash ever computed. Versioned by
  `CANONICAL_SCHEMA_VERSION` (`draft-v0.1`), which the hash covers; bump
  deliberately.
- Chain rule: `sha256(bytes.fromhex(prev_hash) || link_bytes())`, where
  `link_bytes()` excludes the `hash` field. Genesis is 64 zeros.
- `append(payload=...)` hashes the payload and discards it. Never add a
  field that retains it — events stay content-free (opaque refs + payload
  hash).
- The in-memory `AuditLog` is M0 scaffolding; M1's database store must
  produce byte-identical events. Treat its semantics as the specification.

## Tests

`tests/conftest.py` synthesises an importable `testkit_fake_provider` in
`sys.modules` so the registry's `importlib` path is testable without a real
provider; use that double rather than adding a provider package to make a
test pass.

```bash
python -m pytest platform/core -q
```

## Keeping this file true

Update it when you add a module or endpoint, touch the canonicalization or
chain rule, or change how tests fake a provider.
