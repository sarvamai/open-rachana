"""Where sources and their extracted artefacts live, for this slice.

The index is a dictionary in this process and the artefacts are files under a
workspace directory. That is a deliberate stand-in, not a design: there is no
`db/` yet, so restarting the API forgets every source, and running more than
one worker gives each its own index. Both go away when the sources table
lands — `SourceStore` is the only thing that has to change.

Because there is no transaction, this slice writes **no audit events**. An
audit event must commit with the state change it records (invariant 2), and
appending to the chain from a store with no transaction would produce a
chain that cannot be trusted. Ingestion becomes auditable in the same change
that gives it a database.

Every public method holds `_lock`. The core-api handlers are sync `def`, so
Starlette runs them concurrently on the anyio threadpool — without it,
`list` sorting while `create` inserts raises
`RuntimeError: dictionary changed size during iteration`, the same race
`SessionMonitor` documents. The lock is what becomes the database
transaction.

The lock also makes check-then-write **atomic**, which is what keeps a
delete from racing the extraction job: every artefact write goes through
`write_if_live`, which re-checks the record under the lock before touching
disk. An artefact is therefore either written while the record was live
(and `delete`'s `rmtree` removes it) or refused after the delete — a deleted
source can never be resurrected on disk. `get` returns the live record, not
a copy: the pipeline mutates it only on the event loop and field writes are
GIL-atomic, so a reader sees a stage boundary, never a half-written one —
the discipline the database store inherits.
