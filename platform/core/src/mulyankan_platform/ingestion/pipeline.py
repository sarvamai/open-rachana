"""The extraction pipeline: three stages over one uploaded document.

    Reading document → Extracting pages → Rendering cover

One pass, one open session. Text and images come out of the same
`extract_page` call, so they are one stage rather than two — splitting the
label would mean either a second pass or a stage that reports a duration it
did not spend.

Every stage is blocking CPU work and runs in a worker thread; the record is
mutated only on the event loop, so a reader polling the job never sees a
half-written stage.

The pipeline decides which pages have a text layer and which do not. That
decision is the platform's, not a provider's: it is what will route pages to
the `ocr` SPI when that slice lands, and it is taken **per page** rather than
per document, so a book with thirty scanned plates among three hundred
digital pages reports thirty pages needing OCR instead of being misread as
one kind of document.

Nothing here logs extracted text (DAT-03).
