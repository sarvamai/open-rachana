"""`text_is_usable`: telling extracted text from extracted glyph indices.

The samples here are taken from real PDFs. A book whose fonts declare no
ToUnicode CMap still hands PyMuPDF a full page of characters — they are the
font's glyph indices, which land in the dingbat and private-use blocks — so
`has_text_layer` alone says a page is readable when none of it is.

This is a pure function rather than an API test because a garbled PDF cannot
be built with PyMuPDF: its writer always emits a valid CMap. Forging one
would test the fixture, not the rule.
