# ADR-0003: Platform and provider architecture — deterministic core, pluggable edges

- Status: Accepted. Amended 2026-09-09: the `telemetry` row is satisfied by
  adopting OpenTelemetry rather than by a project SPI — see "Telemetry
  (amended 2026-09-09)" below and ADR-0011.

## Context

The product direction requires a platform design in which many solutions can
plug in. The v4 specification simultaneously demands that the workflow core be
deterministic, auditable, and free of AI (ARC-12 as amended), that validation,
review, accessibility, sealing and readiness never call a model, and that
switching any environmental component — identity, storage, keys, models — must
not change Layer 1 code (architecture note: "Switching costs nothing in the
core").

## Decision

Every component belongs to exactly one of two classes.

### The core (non-pluggable, in `platform/`)

The lifecycle state machine and its guards; the authorization engine
(permission matrix, capability registry, separation of duties); the
hash-chained audit store and verifier; the transactional outbox; the sealing
orchestrator; the readiness calculator; expected-evidence assertions; the API
surface and event schemas. These embody the invariants the authority must own.
They are versioned, never swapped at runtime, and no provider can alter their
decisions.

### Providers (pluggable, in `providers/`)

Implementations of versioned service-provider interfaces (SPIs) defined in
`mulyankan-spi`:

| SPI | Purpose | Consumer | Deterministic |
|---|---|---|---|
| identity | OIDC sign-in, MFA, device posture, zone claims | sign-in, every request | n/a (human) |
| storage | object store for assets and sealed artefacts | assets, sealing | yes |
| kms | encrypt/decrypt/sign under managed keys | sealing, export | yes |
| sanitize | quarantine, malware scan, re-encode, strip metadata | asset upload | yes |
| similarity | deterministic duplicate detection | validation (QST03-VAL-06) | yes |
| render | reference rendering contract | preview, review, accessibility | yes |
| gateway | model proposals with provenance (Layer 2) | authoring resources only | no (proposals only) |
| notify | signed outbound notifications to downstream | lifecycle events | yes |
| telemetry | OTLP sink for metrics, traces, logs (see amendment: no project SPI; ADR-0011) | observability | n/a |
| export | portable export profile (QTI 3.0 candidate) | readiness handoff | yes |

### Telemetry (amended 2026-09-09)

The `telemetry` row is not implemented as a `Protocol` in `mulyankan-spi`.
OpenTelemetry already supplies the interface (its API and OTLP), the binding
(its environment variables) and the conformance target (its specification),
so the project adopts it directly; ADR-0011 records the decision and the
mapping. Two rules below apply differently at that seam: rule 1's "refused at
call time" does not hold (an unconfigured sink drops signals and the request
still serves), and rule 4's conformance suite is replaced by OTel compliance
plus the core's own content-free test.

### Rules that make pluggability safe

1. The platform never imports a provider directly. Bindings live in
   per-environment configuration (`platform.yaml`) and are resolved by the
   provider registry at startup. A capability with no binding is refused at
   call time — the same rule as a model removed from the approved list.
2. Providers cannot mutate workflow state, write audit events, or bypass
   validation. They receive inputs and return outputs; the platform records
   each interaction as a content-free audit event.
3. SPIs on the validation/sealing path (sanitize, similarity, kms, storage,
   export) must be deterministic; the bound provider's name and version are
   recorded in manifests and the audit chain.
4. Every SPI ships a conformance suite in `mulyankan-spi`. A provider is
   certifiable only when its suite passes in CI; results are publishable —
   the Layer 2 conformance-harness pattern applied to every seam.
5. The `gateway` SPI may only return proposals carrying the provenance
   envelope (model id, version, adapter version, material hash,
   prompt-template hash, timestamp). Proposals never reach review without a
   human submission, and nothing in validation, review, accessibility,
   sealing, or readiness may call it.

## Rationale

This applies the architecture note's Layer 2 pattern — published interface,
adapter kit, conformance harness — to every seam of Layer 1, while keeping the
lock-in-prone part (the rules, the records, the seal, the export) inside the
core the authority owns.

## Consequences

- Third parties integrate by implementing an SPI package and passing its
  conformance suite; they never fork the core.
- The reference provider in this repository (`providers/kms-local/`)
  demonstrates the full path: SPI implementation, conformance test,
  configuration binding.
- Provider distributions depend only on `mulyankan-spi`, never on the platform
  core, keeping the dependency arrow pointing outward.
- SPIs are added in the milestone that first consumes them, so interfaces are
  designed against real callers rather than speculation.
